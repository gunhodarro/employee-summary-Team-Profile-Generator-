As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. The project will generate a team.html page in the output directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

Name

Role

ID

Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
